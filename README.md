# quant

Exploring how ideas from applied mathematics, physics, and signal processing can be applied to predicting market time series. Several methodologies will be compared:
* Time series analysis and differential equations
    - Simplex projection is particularly of interest
* Machine learning: quantitative 
    - LSTM
    - Clustering (which could tie in to a graph based model)
* Machine learning: qualititative 
    - Sentiment Analysis
